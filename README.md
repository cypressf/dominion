Dominion Randomizer Webapp Development Branch
=============================================

This is the branch to clone if you want the most up-to-date code, but there may be strange bugs. Expect more trouble installing and running the app.


Overview
--------
A very quick randomizer for the [Dominion card game](http://www.riograndegames.com/games.html?id=278). There are many existing randomizer websites, but they work poorly on mobile phones, and suffer from small usability problems. The goal of this randomizer is to make randomizing a desired deck of cards as fast and easy as possible.

API
---
You can get details about any dominion card by submitting a GET request to [dominion.olinapps.com/api/cards](http://dominion.olinapps.com/api/cards), and [dominion.olinapps.com/api/cards/card_id](http://dominion.olinapps.com/api/cards/1) (where card_id is the integer id of a card you want, e.g. [dominion.olinapps.com/api/cards/100](http://dominion.olinapps.com/api/cards/100)). You can make a GET request to [dominion.olinapps.com/api/expansions](http://dominion.olinapps.com/api/expansions) to get the expansions.

Filter results using these optional parameters:

```
    "min_cost_treasure"
    "max_cost_treasure"
    "min_cost_potion"
    "max_cost_potions"
    "min_plus_actions"
    "max_plus_actions"
    "min_plus_treasure"
    "max_plus_treasure"
    "min_plus_cards"
    "max_plus_cards"
    "min_plus_buys"
    "max_plus_buys"
    "min_victory_points"
    "max_victory_points"
    "min_trashes"
    "max_trashes"
    "is_attack"
    "is_reaction"
    "min_treasure"
    "max_treasure"
    "min_victory_points"
    "max_victory_points"
```


Technical Overview
------------------
It's a webapp using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) on the backend and javascript on the frontend. The backend contains the database with cards in it, and an API that can be accessed by the frontend in order to get and modify cards. The backend contains randomization logic, which should be built-in to the API eventually, but the frontend contains also contains all the needed logic to act as a stand-alone app. It saves all the card-data in `localStorage.cards` and will function as an offline-app when appcaching is enabled.

Installation instructions
-------------------------

### Requirements
*   python 2.7
*   [virtualenv](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv) ([virtualenvwrapper](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) or [virtualenvwrapper for windows](https://github.com/davidmarble/virtualenvwrapper-win) recommended)
*   [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html)
*   [postgresql](http://www.postgresql.org/download/) (or another SQL database that's compatible with SQLAlchemy)


Use the installation method of your choice to get all the requirements on your computer. Mac users: I recommend using [homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) to install what you can. Linux users: I recommend using your favorite package manager (apt-get, yum, pacman, etc). Windows users: [chocolatey](http://chocolatey.org/) package manager may help.


### Python package installation

Create a virtualenv for this project, and activate it. If you installed virtualenvwrapper, this is simple.

```bash
mkvirtualenv dominion
```

Whenever you want to work on this project in the future, remember to enter this virtualenv (again, using virtualenvwrapper)
```bash
workon dominion
```

```bash
# get the code
git clone git://github.com/cypressf/dominion.git
# enter the directory you just cloned
cd dominion
# install the python packages required by the server
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### App configuration
Now open up `app.py` and edit the line that says `app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = os.environ['HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_BLUE_URL']`. You'll need to change it to something like `app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = yourdatabaseurlgoeshere`.

Edit the line `_ADMIN_NAME = "cypressf"` to read `_ADMIN_NAME = "your_prefered_admin_username"`

### Initialize database and create admin user
Now open up a python shell. We're going to create your database and add the admin account for the website.
```python
from app import db, User
db.create_all()
admin = User("your_prefered_admin_username", "password")
db.session.add(admin)
db.session.commit()
```

The admin user is needed for basic authentication when using the API to modify the database.

### Run the server
```bash
python app.py
````
And visit [http://0.0.0.0:5000/](http://0.0.0.0:5000/). You should see a website that looks like [dominion.olinapps.com](http://dominion.olinapps.com), except it won't do anything, because there are no cards in your database!

### Populate your database with cards!
```bash
python scripts/add_to_db.py
````
